There are five sections, each with a time\nlimit of 35 minutes. The supervisor will tell you when to begin and end each section. If you finish a section before time is\ncalled, you may check your work on that section only; do not turn to any other section of the test book and do not work\non any other section either in the test book or on the answer sheet.\nThere are several different types of questions on the test, and each question type has its own directions. Be sure you\nunderstand the directions for each question type before attempting to answer any questions in that section.\nNot everyone will finish all the questions in the time allowed. Do not hurry, but work steadily and as quickly as you can\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. You are advised to use your time effectively. If a question seems too difficult, go on to the\nnext one and return to the difficult question after completing the section. MARK THE BEST ANSWER YOU CAN FOR\nEVERY QUESTION. NO DEDUCTIONS WILL BE MADE FOR WRONG ANSWERS. YOUR SCORE WILL BE BASED ONLY\nON THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS YOU ANSWER CORRECTLY.\nALL YOUR ANSWERS MUST BE MARKED ON THE ANSWER SHEET. Answer spaces for each question are lettered to\ncorrespond with the letters of the potential answers to each question in the test book. After you have decided which of\nthe answers is correct, blacken the corresponding space on the answer sheet. BE SURE THAT EACH MARK IS BLACK\nAND COMPLETELY FILLS THE ANSWER SPACE. Give only one answer to each question. If you change an answer, be\nsure that all previous marks are erased completely. Since the answer sheet is machine scored, incomplete erasures may\nbe interpreted as intended answers. ANSWERS RECORDED IN THE TEST BOOK WILL NOT BE SCORED.\nThere may be more question numbers on this answer sheet than there are questions in a section. Do not be concerned,\nbut be certain that the section and number of the question you are answering matches the answer sheet section and\nquestion number. Additional answer spaces in any answer sheet section should be left blank. Begin your next section in\nthe number one answer space for that section.\nLSAC takes various steps to ensure that answer sheets are returned from test centers in a timely manner for processing.\nIn the unlikely event that an answer sheet is not received, LSAC will permit the examinee either to retest at no additional\nfee or to receive a refund of his or her LSAT fee. THESE REMEDIES ARE THE ONLY REMEDIES AVAILABLE IN THE\nUNLIKELY EVENT THAT AN ANSWER SHEET IS NOT RECEIVED BY LSAC.\nHOW DID YOU PREPARE FOR THE LSAT?\nScore Cancellation\n(Select all that apply.)\nComplete this section only if you are Responses to this item are voluntary and will be used for statistical research purposes only.\nabsolutely certain you want to cancel\nBy studying the free sample questions available on LSAC\u2019s website.\nyour score.

Read the topic and the accompanying directions carefully.\nYou will probably find it best to spend a few minutes considering the topic and organizing your thoughts before you begin writing. In your essay,\nbe sure to develop your ideas fully, leaving time, if possible, to review what you have written. Do not write on a topic other than the one\nspecified. Writing on a topic of your own choice is not acceptable.\nNo special knowledge is required or expected for this writing exercise. Law schools are interested in the reasoning, clarity, organization,\nlanguage usage, and writing mechanics displayed in your essay. How well you write is more important than how much you write.\nConfine your essay to the blocked, lined area on the front and back of the separate Writing Sample Response Sheet. Only that area will be\nreproduced for law schools. Be sure that your writing is legible.\nBoth this topic sheet and your response sheet must be turned over to the testing staff\nbefore you leave the room.\nTopic Code Print Your Full Name Here\nLast First M.I.\n030187\nDate Sign Your Name Here\n/ /\nScratch Paper\nDo not write your essay in this space.\nLSAT\u00ae Writing Sample Topic\n\u00a9 2007 by Law School Admission Council, Inc.

There\nis no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d choice: a reasonable argument can be made for either.\nBLZ Stores, an established men\u2019s clothing retailer with a chain of stores in a major metropolitan area, is selecting a plan for expansion.\nUsing the facts below, write an essay in which you argue for one of the following plans over the other based on the following two criteria:\n\u2022 The company wants to increase its profits.\n\u2022 The company wants to ensure its long-term financial stability.\nThe \u201cnational plan\u201d is to open a large number of men\u2019s clothing stores throughout the country over a short period of time. In doing this,\nthe company would incur considerable debt. It would also have to greatly increase staff and develop national marketing and distribution\ncapabilities. Many regional companies that adopted this strategy increased their profits dramatically. A greater number tried and failed,\nsuffering severe financial consequences. BLZ is not well known outside its home area. Research indicates that the BLZ name is viewed\npositively by those who know it. National clothing chains can offer lower prices because of their greater buying power. BLZ currently faces\nincreasingly heavy competition in its home region from such chains.\nThe \u201cregional plan\u201d is to increase the number and size of stores in the company\u2019s home region and upgrade their facilities, product quality,\nand service. This could be achieved for the most part with existing cash reserves. These upgrades would generally increase the prices that BLZ\ncharges. In one trial store in which such changes were implemented, sales and profits have increased. The local population is growing. BLZ\nenjoys strong customer loyalty. Regional expansion could be accomplished primarily using BLZ\u2019s experienced and loyal staff and would allow\ncontinued reliance on known and trusted suppliers, contractors, and other business connections.
