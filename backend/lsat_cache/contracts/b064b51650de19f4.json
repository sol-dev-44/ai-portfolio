  "summary": "This contract contains two separate agreements with significantly different risk profiles. The Mobile App Development Agreement has moderate risks primarily around delivery acceptance criteria and IP ownership clarity. The Gym Membership Agreement presents high risks with extremely broad liability waivers, harsh termination terms, and one-sided indemnification clauses that heavily favor the facility.",

  "risks": [
    {
      "type": "delivery",
      "severity": 7,
      "location": "Developer warrants the application will substantially conform to specifications for 60 days post-launch",
      "explanation": "Vague acceptance criteria using 'substantially conform' creates dispute risk. No objective acceptance process or deemed acceptance clause.",
      "suggested_fix": "Define specific, objective acceptance criteria with clear testing procedures and deemed acceptance timeline",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Client shall have 10 business days to test deliverables against specifications in Exhibit A. Acceptance deemed granted if no written rejection with specific defects is provided within this period. Rejection must identify specific non-conformance with objective specifications."
    },
    {
      "type": "payment",
      "severity": 6,
      "location": "Late payments accrue 2% monthly interest and pause all development",

      "suggested_fix": "Add grace period before work stoppage and define restart procedures",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Late payments accrue 2% monthly interest. If payment remains outstanding 15 days after due date, Developer may suspend work with 5 days written notice. Work resumes within 2 business days of payment receipt."

      "rewrite_suggestion": "Developer retains ownership of: (a) pre-existing code libraries and frameworks developed prior to this Agreement, (b) third-party open source components, and (c) general programming techniques and methodologies.

    {
      "type": "liability",
      "severity": 9,
      "location": "Member releases and waives all claims against Facility... for any injury, illness, death, or property damage... including claims arising from: Equipment malfunction or defect, Negligence of staff or other members",
      "explanation": "Extremely broad liability waiver attempting to cover facility's own negligence, which may not be enforceable in many jurisdictions and creates significant risk exposure for the member",
      "suggested_fix": "Limit waiver to inherent risks of exercise, exclude gross negligence and intentional misconduct",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Member acknowledges the inherent risks of physical exercise and waives claims for injuries arising from such inherent risks, provided that this waiver does not extend to claims arising from Facility's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of applicable safety regulations."

      "explanation": "One-sided indemnification clause requiring member to defend facility against all third-party claims, even those caused by facility's negligence",
      "suggested_fix": "Limit indemnification to member's own misconduct or negligence",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Member shall indemnify Facility only for third-party claims directly caused by Member's willful misconduct or material breach of facility rules, provided Facility was not negligent or at fault."
    },
    {
      "type": "termination",
      "severity": 8,
      "location": "Early termination requires payment of $299 buyout fee plus 50% of remaining monthly dues... Member may cancel after initial term with 60 days written notice sent via certified mail to corporate headquarters",
      "explanation": "Extremely harsh early termination penalties and burdensome cancellation procedures that heavily favor the facility",
      "suggested_fix": "Reduce penalties and simplify cancellation process",

    },
    {
      "type": "general",
