  "summary": "This SaaS agreement is extremely one-sided in favor of the Provider, with multiple high-severity risks including uncapped customer liability, perpetual data rights grants, non-refundable fees, and automatic renewals with excessive notice requirements. The contract lacks standard customer protections and contains several potentially unenforceable clauses.",
