  "summary": "This is an extremely predatory contract that appears designed to exploit and control the founder through unconscionable terms. It contains multiple provisions that would likely be unenforceable in most jurisdictions due to their oppressive nature, including personal guarantees of unlimited liability, 15-year non-compete restrictions, assignment of all future IP, and irrevocable powers of attorney. The overall structure resembles a debt bondage arrangement rather than a legitimate investment agreement.",
