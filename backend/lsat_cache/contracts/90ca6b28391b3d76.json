  "summary": "This freelance consulting agreement has moderate risk exposure with several areas requiring attention. Key concerns include extended payment terms (45 days), broad 'work for hire' language that could capture background IP, and asymmetric liability caps. The contract includes reasonable confidentiality and non-compete provisions, but lacks mutual termination rights and has some ambiguous termination language.",

    {
      "type": "payment",
      "severity": 6,
      "location": "Payment due within 45 days of invoice receipt... Pre-approved expenses reimbursed within 60 days",
      "explanation": "45-day payment terms are longer than industry standard (Net 30) and create cash flow risk. 60-day expense reimbursement is excessive.",
      "suggested_fix": "Negotiate shorter payment terms and expense reimbursement periods",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Payment due within 30 days of invoice receipt. Pre-approved expenses reimbursed within 30 days with receipts."

      "severity": 7,
      "location": "All work product created under this Agreement shall be considered 'work for hire' and owned exclusively by Company",
      "explanation": "Broad 'work for hire' language could inadvertently transfer consultant's background IP and general methodologies to the company.",
      "suggested_fix": "Clarify that only specific deliverables are work for hire, not general knowledge or pre-existing IP",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Deliverables specifically created for Company under SOWs shall be owned by Company. Consultant retains ownership of general knowledge, experience, and pre-existing methodologies."

      "type": "termination",
      "severity": 6,
      "location": "Company may terminate immediately for cause, defined at Company's reasonable discretion... No payment for work-in-progress that cannot be reasonably utilized",
      "explanation": "Asymmetric termination rights favor Company. 'Reasonable discretion' for cause is vague. Risk of non-payment for work-in-progress.",
      "suggested_fix": "Define specific causes for termination and ensure payment for all work performed",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Either party may terminate immediately for material breach after 5 days written notice to cure. Consultant shall be paid for all work completed through termination date."

      "location": "Consultant's total liability shall not exceed fees paid in the 6 months preceding the claim. Company's liability shall not exceed $50,000",
      "explanation": "Asymmetric liability caps - Company's cap is fixed while Consultant's varies with fees paid, potentially creating imbalance.",
      "suggested_fix": "Make liability caps mutual and proportional",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Each party's total liability shall not exceed the lesser of $50,000 or fees paid in the 12 months preceding the claim."
