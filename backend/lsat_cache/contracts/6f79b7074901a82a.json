  "summary": "This contract represents an extremely predatory agreement with catastrophic risk levels across multiple dimensions. The document appears designed to systematically strip the founder of all assets, rights, and future earning capacity while providing minimal consideration. Multiple clauses would likely be unenforceable due to unconscionability, but the litigation costs alone could be ruinous. This contract should be rejected entirely.",
