  "risks": [
    {
      "type": "termination",
      "severity": 9,
      "location": "Term: 5 years with no early termination option for Tenant",
      "explanation": "Tenant is locked into a 5-year commitment with no ability to exit early, creating significant business flexibility risk and potential financial liability if circumstances change",
      "suggested_fix": "Add termination for convenience clause with reasonable notice period",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Term: 5 years. Tenant may terminate with 6 months written notice after the second year, with payment of 3 months additional rent as early termination fee."
    },
    {
      "type": "termination",
      "severity": 10,
      "location": "Landlord may terminate with 10 days notice for any breach. Tenant remains liable for full remaining lease term upon default",
      "explanation": "Extremely harsh default provision allows quick termination while maintaining full financial liability for the entire remaining term, creating catastrophic financial risk",
      "suggested_fix": "Add cure periods, limit liability upon default, and provide graduated remedies",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Landlord may terminate with 30 days written notice for material breach, provided Tenant has failed to cure within 15 days of written notice. Upon default termination, Tenant liability limited to 6 months additional rent plus actual damages."

    {
      "type": "liability",
      "severity": 8,
      "location": "Tenant responsible for all interior repairs, HVAC maintenance, and any repairs under $5,000",
      "explanation": "Tenant bears disproportionate maintenance responsibility including expensive HVAC systems, creating unpredictable cost exposure",
      "suggested_fix": "Limit tenant repair obligations and add caps on annual maintenance costs",

    {
      "type": "general",
      "severity": 7,
      "location": "Tenant may not assign or sublease without consent. Landlord may withhold consent for any reason. If approved, Landlord receives 50% of any sublease profit",
      "explanation": "Unreasonable assignment restrictions with profit-sharing that eliminates tenant's ability to monetize subleasing and provides landlord absolute discretion",
      "suggested_fix": "Require reasonable consent standard and reduce or eliminate profit sharing",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Tenant may assign or sublease with Landlord's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Landlord entitled to 25% of net sublease profits above base rent."

    {
      "type": "general",
      "severity": 6,
      "location": "Security Deposit: 3 months rent ($13,500), non-interest bearing, returned within 90 days of lease end minus deductions at Landlord's discretion",
      "explanation": "Large security deposit with discretionary deductions and no interest creates cash flow burden and potential for arbitrary withholding",
      "suggested_fix": "Reduce deposit amount, add interest requirement, and limit deduction discretion",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Security Deposit: 2 months rent, bearing interest at prevailing savings rate. Returned within 30 days with itemized deductions for actual damages only."

      "location": "Tenant shall build out space at own expense (~$80,000 estimated). All improvements become Landlord property. Landlord may require restoration to original condition at lease end",
      "explanation": "Tenant invests significant capital in improvements that become landlord's property, with potential additional restoration costs creating double financial burden",
      "suggested_fix": "Allow tenant to remove improvements or provide compensation for improvements",
      "rewrite_suggestion": "Tenant improvements over $25,000 may be removed by Tenant at lease end, or Tenant may elect to leave improvements with no restoration requirement."
