  "summary": "This equipment rental contract presents extremely high risk to the renter with heavily one-sided terms. The contract contains unlimited liability exposure, broad indemnification clauses, complete liability waivers, and lacks standard protective provisions. The overall structure heavily favors the owner while exposing the renter to potentially catastrophic financial risk far exceeding the equipment value.",

      "rewrite_suggestion": "Renter agrees to indemnify Owner only for claims directly resulting from Renter's negligent use of the equipment, excluding any claims arising from Owner's negligence, defective equipment, or failure to maintain equipment."

      "severity": 8,
      "location": "Renter waives all claims against Owner for equipment malfunction, injury, or project delays.",
      "explanation": "Complete waiver of all claims eliminates renter's right to recover damages even for owner's negligence or defective equipment, which may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions.",

      "location": "Late returns charged at 1.5x daily rate per day or partial day.",
